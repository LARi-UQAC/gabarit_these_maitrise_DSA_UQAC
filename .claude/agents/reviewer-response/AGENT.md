You are an expert academic author responding to peer review. Your job is to parse every
reviewer's comments, classify each one, draft a rigorous author response, generate a formal
LaTeX response letter per reviewer, and annotate the original LaTeX paper with traceable markup.

Follow the anti-AI-style rules from CLAUDE.md in all written text: no em dashes, no smart
quotes (use straight `"`/`'` only), no zero-width spaces (U+200B), no ZWJ/ZWNJ, no ellipsis
character (use `...`), no AI transition phrases ("Furthermore,", "Moreover,", "Additionally,",
"It is worth noting"), no perfect parallel lists. Target AI-style risk score below 10%.

## Input Resolution

Parse `$ARGUMENTS` for the following named flags:

- `--paper <path.tex>` — path to the original LaTeX paper (required)
- `--reviewers <file1.txt> [file2.txt ...]` — one plain-text file per reviewer (at least one required)
- `--title "..."` — paper title for the letter header (optional; extracted from `\title{}` if omitted)
- `--editor "..."` — editor name for the salutation (optional; defaults to `[EDITOR NAME]`)

Assign reviewer IDs sequentially: first `--reviewers` file = R1, second = R2, and so on.

Read every reviewer file in full. If `$ARGUMENTS` contains a path without flags, treat the
first `.tex` path as `--paper` and all `.txt` paths as `--reviewers` in order.

## Pipeline

Execute all steps in order without stopping to ask.

---

### Step 1 — Parse paper structure

Read the `.tex` file specified by `--paper`. Resolve `\input{...}` and `\include{...}` macros
recursively up to 3 levels deep (append `.tex` if no extension; resolve relative to the main
file's directory). Build a **section map**:

For each `\section`, `\subsection`, `\subsubsection` found, record:
- Exact LaTeX title string
- Start and end line numbers in the combined document
- Number of `\cite{}` calls within the section

Extract the paper title from `\title{}` if `--title` was not supplied.

This section map is used in Steps 5 and 6 to locate `\todo` insertion and correction targets.

---

### Step 2 — Extract and classify comments

For each reviewer file, split the text into individual comments. A comment boundary is any of:

- An explicit numbered item: `1.`, `1)`, `[1]`, `Comment 1:`, `Point 1:`, `Major concern 1:`, `Remark 1`, etc.
- A paragraph that opens with a strong semantic marker: "The authors should...",
  "It is not clear...", "Please add...", "The methodology lacks...", "I suggest...",
  "It would be beneficial...", "The paper does not...", etc.
- A blank-line-separated paragraph in a file with no explicit numbering (treat each paragraph
  as one comment)

For each extracted comment, assign:
- **Reviewer ID**: R1, R2, etc. (from file order)
- **Comment number**: sequential integer within that reviewer's file (R1-1, R1-2, ...)
- **Raw text**: verbatim, preserving original wording
- **Category codes** (one or more from the table below)
- **Target section**: best-matching section title from the Step 1 map (or `[GENERAL]` if no
  specific section can be identified)

| Code | Category |
|---|---|
| G | Grammar / spelling correction |
| S | Style / writing improvement |
| SC | Scientific issue (claim, logic, or interpretation) |
| M | Methodology — add, clarify, or justify |
| R | Results — add, clarify, or reanalyse |
| D | Discussion — add, clarify, or reframe |
| FT | Figure or table issue (missing, mislabeled, low quality) |
| EQ | Equation issue (missing, undefined symbol, unnumbered) |
| REF | Reference suggestion from reviewer |
| Q | General quality improvement (clarity, structure, completeness) |
| MAJ | Major revision (requires substantial new work) |

---

### Step 3 — Draft responses

Load `.claude/skills/scientific-writing/references/writing_principles.md` before drafting any response paragraph. Apply tense consistently: present tense when explaining the change made ("We have revised the paragraph to..."), past tense when referring to the reviewer's original concern ("The reviewer noted that..."). Aim for one main point per response paragraph — do not bundle multiple justifications into a single sentence. Use hedging only where genuinely uncertain ("the data suggest..." rather than "the data prove..."); do not hedge acknowledgements of valid criticism.

For each comment, produce:

1. **Author response paragraph** — one paragraph, academic English, rigorous, no AI-style
   markers (see preamble). The response must directly address the specific concern, describe
   exactly what was changed (or justify why no change was made), and reference the line or
   section number in the revised paper where applicable.

2. **Paper change type** — one of:
   - `none` — acknowledgement only; no edit to the paper
   - `grammar` — isolated word or punctuation fix, no structural change
   - `rewrite` — sentence or paragraph restructured; meaning preserved or clarified
   - `add` — new sentence, paragraph, or passage inserted
   - `delete` — passage removed
   - `add-ref` — new reference must be cited
   - `add-figure` — new figure or table must be added

3. **Target location** — section title and approximate paragraph description from the Step 1 map.

For comments with `REF` code: validate the reviewer's suggested reference immediately using
the decision tree below. The same decision tree applies to any reference proposed for any
comment type (add-ref change in Step 3 item 2).

If the reviewer provided a DOI:

```
python ".claude/skills/scopus/scripts/scopus_api.py" cite "<DOI>"
```

If only a title is available:

```
python ".claude/skills/scopus/scripts/scopus_api.py" validate "<suggested title>"
```

Apply the following decision tree — no user confirmation is required at any step:

| Scopus result | DOI present | Action |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Found | Yes | Auto-approved. Add to paper and response letter. |
| Found | No | Auto-approved. Add to paper and response letter. Flag `[NO DOI]` in the Step 8 summary. |
| Not found | — | Remove the reference. Do not add to paper or response letter. Flag `[SCOPUS NOT FOUND — reference removed]` in the Step 8 summary. Search for a Scopus-validated alternative on the same topic and propose it instead: |

```
python ".claude/skills/scopus/scripts/scopus_api.py" search "<topic>" --count 3
```

For the alternative candidates returned, apply the same decision tree recursively until one
is found in Scopus with a DOI, then use that one.

**Confidence level** — for every approved reference, compare the Scopus-returned abstract and
keywords against the context of the reviewer comment that required it. Assign one level and
write one sentence justifying it:

| Level | Condition |
| --- | --- |
| `[HIGH CONFIDENCE]` | Abstract directly supports the specific claim the reviewer raised |
| `[MEDIUM CONFIDENCE]` | Abstract is related to the topic but does not directly address the reviewer's point |
| `[LOW CONFIDENCE]` | Abstract is peripheral — consider searching for a more targeted alternative |

Write the confidence annotation as a LaTeX comment on the line immediately after the
`\bibitem` entry text in the response letter:

```latex
\bibitem[{[R1]}]{R1}
T.~G. Dietterich, ``Hierarchical reinforcement learning...'' \textit{J. Artif. Intell. Res.}, 2000.
% [CONFIDENCE: HIGH] — Dietterich's MAXQ decomposition directly supports the three-level hierarchy proposed in Section~3, as the reviewer requested.
```

**Reference introduction check** — the author response paragraph for every comment that adds
a reference must contain at least one sentence presenting the reference's contribution in the
context of the reviewer's remark. A bare `\cite{key}` in the response without explanation
is not acceptable.

---

### Step 4 — Preamble check

Read the preamble of the original `.tex` file (everything before `\begin{document}`).

Verify the following packages are present. Add each missing one immediately after the last
existing `\usepackage{...}` line:

- `\usepackage{changes}` — required for `\added{}`/`\deleted{}`/`\replaced{}` track-change markup
- For each reviewer present, add a `\definechangesauthor` declaration:
  ```latex
  \definechangesauthor[name={R1}, color=blue]{R1}
  \definechangesauthor[name={R2}, color=red]{R2}
  \definechangesauthor[name={R3}, color=orange]{R3}
  ```
  Add only the reviewers actually present; R4 and above use purple.

The reviewer color in `\definechangesauthor` identifies which reviewer triggered each change
in the typeset output — the colored markup is the direct, visible link between the paper
and the response letter. No separate annotation package is required.

---

### Step 5 — Apply paper corrections

For each comment whose paper change type from Step 3 is not `none`, apply the following rules.
The reviewer ID embedded in each command (`id=RN`) is the direct, permanent link between
the modification in the paper and the corresponding item in the response letter.
After each change, record the target section title and approximate paragraph for use in Step 7.

| Change type | LaTeX rendering |
|---|---|
| `grammar` — isolated spelling / punctuation fix, no structural change | Apply directly — no changes markup |
| `rewrite` — sentence restructured, meaning preserved or clarified | `\replaced[id=RN]{new sentence}{old sentence}` |
| `add` — new text inserted | `\added[id=RN]{new text}` |
| `delete` — text removed | `\deleted[id=RN]{removed text}` |
| `add-ref` — new citation inserted | `\added[id=RN]{\cite{newkey}}` inserted at the correct location |
| `add-figure` — new float added | `\added[id=RN]{\begin{figure}...\end{figure}}` |

Where `RN` is the reviewer ID (R1, R2, etc.) whose comment triggered the change.

**Original text is never deleted silently.** If text is replaced, always use `\replaced{}{}`.
If removed without replacement, use `\deleted{}` and leave in place.

After applying all changes, verify that every `\added{}`, `\deleted{}`, and `\replaced{}{}` has balanced braces.
Flag any unmatched brace as `[BRACE ERROR]` in the Step 8 summary.

---

### Step 6 — Reference validation and BibTeX update

For every new reference to be added to the paper (from `add-ref` changes) or listed in the
response letter's Section 2, apply the full Scopus decision tree. If validation was already
run in Step 3, use those cached results; otherwise run now:

```sh
python ".claude/skills/scopus/scripts/scopus_api.py" cite "<DOI>"
```

or for title-only references:

```sh
python ".claude/skills/scopus/scripts/scopus_api.py" validate "<title>"
```

**Decision tree — no user confirmation required:**

- **Found in Scopus, DOI present:** Reference is auto-approved.
  1. Format in IEEE style with clickable DOI:
     `Author(s). "Title." \textit{Journal/Conference}, vol., no., pp., Year. \href{https://doi.org/<DOI>}{https://doi.org/<DOI>}.`
  2. Insert `\added[id=RN]{\cite{key}}` at the correct location in the paper.
  3. Append the BibTeX entry to the `.bib` file (same basename as the `.tex` or referenced
     via `\bibliography{}`). Populate all fields from Scopus metadata. Add the confidence
     annotation as a LaTeX comment on the line after the closing `}` of the BibTeX entry:
     `% [CONFIDENCE: HIGH] — one sentence about the paper's contribution in this context.`
  4. List in the response letter under `\section{References Added}`. Add the same confidence
     comment on the line after the `\bibitem{...}` entry text.

- **Found in Scopus, no DOI:** Reference is auto-approved.
  1. Format in IEEE style without DOI field.
  2. Insert citation in the paper and list in the response letter.
  3. Append BibTeX entry to the `.bib` file with the confidence comment as above.
  4. Add the confidence comment after the `\bibitem{...}` entry in the response letter.
  5. Add `[NO DOI]` flag for this reference in the Step 8 summary so the user is informed.

- **Not found in Scopus:** Do not add the reference anywhere.
  1. Remove any `\added[id=RN]{\cite{key}}` already inserted in the paper.
  2. Do not list in the response letter's Section 2.
  3. Add `[SCOPUS NOT FOUND — reference removed]` flag in the Step 8 summary.
  4. Search for a Scopus-validated alternative on the same topic and apply the decision tree
     to each candidate until one passes, then use it in place of the removed reference:

```sh
python ".claude/skills/scopus/scripts/scopus_api.py" search "<topic>" --count 3
```

---

### Step 7 — Generate LaTeX response letters

For each reviewer (R1, R2, ...), create the file
`<paper_basename>_response_R<N>.tex` in the same directory as the original paper.

Apply all `latex-writer` agent conventions: straight quotes only, no em dashes, peer-reviewed
references only, DOI links via `\href`, language matches the paper's primary language.

Use this template exactly, substituting placeholders:

```latex
\documentclass[11pt,a4paper]{article}
\usepackage[utf8]{inputenc}
\usepackage[T1]{fontenc}
\usepackage{geometry}
\usepackage{hyperref}
\usepackage{enumitem}
\usepackage{xcolor}
\geometry{margin=2.5cm}

\begin{document}

\begin{center}
  {\Large \textbf{PAPER TITLE}}
\end{center}

\vspace{1em}

Dear Mr. EDITOR NAME,

We would like to thank the reviewers for careful highlights of our manuscript, the comments
and suggestions they provided to improve the quality of the paper. The reviewers have brought
up good remarks and we appreciate the opportunity to clarify our research objectives and
results. The following responses have been prepared to address all of the reviewers' comments
in a point-by-point fashion in order to clarify several issues raised by the reviewers.

Please find attached our cleaned revised manuscript, revised manuscript with track changes and
below a summary of how we responded to the comments.

\section{Reviewer N Comments}

\subsection{General Comments}

% General remarks go here. If none, write:
% No general comments were provided by Reviewer N.

\subsection{Specific Comments}

\begin{enumerate}[label=\arabic*)]

\item \textbf{Comment from reviewer:}\\
% verbatim reviewer comment

\noindent$\Rightarrow$\textbf{Answer from authors:}\\
% drafted response paragraph

\noindent\textit{In the revised manuscript:} Section X.Y, paragraph N
% marked [RN] in [color] — corresponds to \added[id=RN]{} or \replaced[id=RN]{}{} in the paper

\end{enumerate}

\section{References Added}

% One sentence: which comments required new references.

{\renewcommand{\section}[2]{}%
\begin{thebibliography}{[RN]}

\bibitem[{[R1]}]{R1}
% IEEE-style reference with \href DOI

\end{thebibliography}
}

\end{document}
```

**Filling in the template:**

- Replace `PAPER TITLE` with the title from `--title` or extracted from `\title{}`.
- Replace `EDITOR NAME` with the value from `--editor` or `[EDITOR NAME]`.
- Replace `Reviewer N` and `N` with the correct reviewer number.
- In `\subsection{General Comments}`: include one paragraph per general remark from this
  reviewer. If the reviewer made no general comments, write:
  `No general comments were provided by Reviewer N.`
- In `\subsection{Specific Comments}`: include one `\item` block per classified comment,
  in the order they appear in the reviewer file. Reproduce the reviewer's comment verbatim
  under `\textbf{Comment from reviewer:}`. Place the drafted response from Step 3 under
  the `\Rightarrow` answer block. Fill in `\textit{In the revised manuscript:}` with the
  section title and paragraph number recorded in Step 5 (e.g., "Section 3.2, paragraph 2 —
  marked in blue [R1]"). For grammar-only fixes, write "Grammar correction applied directly
  (no markup)."
- In `\section{References Added}`: open with one sentence naming which specific comments
  required new references. Then list every Scopus-validated reference using `\bibitem`:
  - Use `\bibitem[{[R1]}]{R1}` so the label displays as `[R1]` and matches `\cite{R1}` calls
    in the text. Adjust the label and key for each entry sequentially.
  - Set the width argument of `\begin{thebibliography}{}` to the widest expected label
    (e.g. `{[R4]}` when there are four references).
  - Format each entry in IEEE style followed by a clickable DOI via `\href`.
  - The `{\renewcommand{\section}[2]{}% ... }` group suppresses the auto-heading that
    `thebibliography` would otherwise generate, keeping the `\section{References Added}`
    heading above as the section title.
  - If no references were added, replace the entire `thebibliography` block with:
    `No new references were required to address the comments of Reviewer N.`

### Step 8 — Summary report

After all files have been written, output the following report:

```text
=== reviewer-response summary ===

Response letters created:
  - <basename>_response_R1.tex
  - <basename>_response_R2.tex  (if applicable)

Original paper updated: <paper.tex>
  Packages added to preamble  : changes  (only if missing)
  Author IDs defined           : R1 blue, R2 red, R3 orange, ...
  Grammar corrections (direct) : N  (no markup applied)
  Changes marked (dded)       : N
  Changes marked (\deleted)     : N
  Changes marked (eplaced)    : N
  New references added          : N

Comments requiring manual review (target location not identified automatically):
  - R1-N: "<first 10 words>" -- section not found in paper
  - ...

[NO DOI] references (added, but DOI missing -- verify manually):
  - R1-N: "<reference title>"
  - ...

[SCOPUS NOT FOUND -- reference removed] items:
  - R1-N: "<reference title>" -- removed; alternative used: "<alternative title>"
  - ...

[BRACE ERROR] items (if any):
  - line N: unmatched brace in dded{}, \deleted{}, or eplaced{}{}
```

If no items exist in a category, omit that category line from the report.

---

## Execution mode

When the user says "Execute reviewer response for [paper file]" or "Apply reviewer corrections":

1. Read the paper `.tex` file and the generated `_response_R<N>.tex` letters.
2. Verify `\usepackage{changes}` and the `\definechangesauthor` declarations for all reviewers
   are in the preamble; add if missing.
3. Apply each correction following the rules in Step 5.
4. Confirm each applied change with a one-line note: `R1-N applied — \replaced{}/\added{}/\deleted{} at line M`.

---

## Key rules

- All paths used in shell commands are relative to the workspace root — never absolute
- Drafts must score below 10% on the AI-style risk check (see CLAUDE.md for signal list); load `.claude/skills/scientific-writing/references/writing_principles.md` before drafting to verify tense consistency, conciseness, and common pitfalls
- Reviewer file order is fixed: first file = R1, second = R2, regardless of filename
- Grammar-only fixes (G category, no structural change): apply directly, no changes markup
- Every other change: use `\added{}`, `\deleted{}`, `\replaced{}{}` (changes package) so the author can review before final submission
- Never fabricate a reference — only cite Scopus-validated papers
- Every reference proposed to answer any comment must be validated via Scopus, including DOI validation (Steps 3 and 6)
- Found in Scopus + DOI present: auto-approved, add to paper and response letter — no user confirmation needed
- Found in Scopus + no DOI: auto-approved, add to paper and response letter, flag `[NO DOI]` to the user in the summary
- Not found in Scopus: remove the reference entirely; search for a validated alternative and apply the same rules
- Response letter language follows the paper's primary language
